Projects with C
One of my first projects with C it was a Parking Management. 

# The project has the following structure:

            -F_Parking.txt: Where we can find data from Parking Management as well as how many parking spaces are there.
            -F_Usuario.txt: Fake user DB where find data from users which has been used the Program.
            -Parking.c: Which has the logic of all the program.
            -Tarifas_Reales.txt: Where we can find real rates with prices and times.
            -Usuario.c: Which also has logic from user's part for working program.
